# Insertion Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in Javascript.

## Description

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

# Example usage
arr = [4,2,9,5,7,8,1,3]
insertion_sort(arr)
